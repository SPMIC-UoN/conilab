#Research

### Scientific Goal
We work at the interface of computational modelling, MRI physics, and neuroscience. Broadly, our scientific goal is to achieve a better
understanding of the structural and functional organisation of the brain at a systems level. We develop computational methodology and
algorithmic/modelling frameworks for analysing neuroimaging data and specifically for mapping brain connections and microstructure using
MRI. Our aim is to provide principled platforms for probing the brain organisation to untangle its complexity in health and disease.

### Contributions to Science

* **Development of modelling frameworks for mapping brain connections and microstructure**<br/>
We devise novel computational frameworks for analysing brain images. Particularly, we have focused on the analysis of multi-dimensional diffusion MRI data, which uniquely allow inference of microstructural tissue properties, as well as of macroscopic connections, non-invasively and in-vivo. Due to the indirect nature of the measurements, advanced signal/image processing techniques and modeling approaches are needed to obtain reliable estimates of the quantities of interest. Such methodology has been developed through our contributions, which allow biophysical information to be extracted from diffusion MRI that otherwise would have only been accessible in humans via post-mortem approaches.

* **Pushing the boundaries of in-vivo brain MRI acquisitions and high-throughput analysis**<br/>
We have been heavily involved with the design and implementation of new technologies that aim to push the boundaries of in-vivo brain MRI
acquisitions and analysis. We have been major contributors to the NIH-fundedHuman Connectome Project, which has contributed to changing the way
neuroimaging data are acquired and processed. These developments have also set the paradigm for subsequent large-scale brain mapping
projects in disease, development and aging. Within the ERC-funded Developing HCP, we have contributed to new methodology for in-vivo
mapping of the neonatal brain in 500 newborn babies. We have also contributed to setting up the acquisition protocols and processing
pipelines for the UK Biobank population-level imaging study (scanning 100,000 subjects). Importantly, we have also contributed to public
data releases through these projects, sharing publicly the wealth of collected data and contributing to *Open Science*.

* **Studying brain organisation in basic and clinical neuroscience**<br/>
Through collaborations with basic and clinical neuroscientists, we have used brain connectivity mapping approaches to explore brain
organisation and re-organisation (e.g. due to plasticity or non-invasive neuromodulation). We also work on extracting patterns of
connectivity (even across species) that can be linked to the functional organisation of the brain. Such connectivity patterns have been used in collaboration with neuro-surgeons for pre-surgical planning and identification of efficacious targets for surgical interventions.

* **Open-source software for neuroimage processing**<br/>
We have a track record of releasing open-source [software](software), impacting research methodology worldwide. We have been one of the main authors
of the HCP processing pipelines, with more than 1,600 citations, and have contributed to the UK Biobank processing pipelines, currently
used to derive imaging-based features from 100,000 subjects. We are co-developers of the FSL open-source software (www.fmrib.ox.ac.uk/fsl) one of the de-facto packages for brain image analysis (with >5,000 users in ~1,00 institutions worldwide).
