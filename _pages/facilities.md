# Facilities

We have access to a number of facilities that allow
[high performance computing](#high-performance-computing) and
cutting-edge [MRI scanning](MRI-scanning].


## High Performance Computing 

We have a number of high performance interactive computing servers,
including:

<li>An 80-core, 0.5 TB RAM and 4x NVIDIA Tesla K80 GP-GPUs</li>
<li>An 80-core, 0.5 TB RAM and 2x NVIDIA Pascal P100 GP-GPUs</li>

We also have access to the Precision Imaging Beacon HPC <b>cluster</b>, which
collectively comprises of:
<li>14 Compute nodes</li>
<li> 600 CPU cores </li>
<li> 10 high-end NVIDIA GP-GPUs (6 Volta V100, 4 Pascal P100)</li>
<li> 7 TB of memory </li>
<li> 250 TB of storage</li>



## MRI Scanning
We benefit from access to cutting-edge human MRI scanners of the Sir
Peter Mansfield Imaging Centre.
