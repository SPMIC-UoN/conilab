# Facilities

We have access to a number of facilities that allow
[high performance computing](#high-performance-computing) and
human [MRI scanning](#mri-scanning).


## High Performance Computing 

We have a number of high performance **interactive servers**.

These include:
* A 80-core, 0.5 TB RAM and 4x NVIDIA Tesla K80 GP-GPUs
* A 80-core, 0.5 TB RAM and 2x NVIDIA Pascal P100 GP-GPUs

We also have access to the Precision Imaging Beacon **HPC cluster**, which
collectively comprises of:
* 14 Compute nodes
* 600 CPU cores 
* 10 high-end NVIDIA GP-GPUs (6 Volta V100, 4 Pascal P100)
* 7 TB of memory 
* 250 TB of storage

## MRI Scanning
We benefit from access to cutting-edge human **MRI scanners** of the Sir
Peter Mansfield Imaging Centre.

These include:
* 0.5 Tesla Paramed Upright Scanner
* 1.5 Tesla GE HDxt Scanner
* 3 Tesla Philips Achieva Scanner  with 80 mT/m gradients
* 3 Tesla Philips Ingenia wide-bore Scanner  with 40 mT/m gradients 
* 3 Tesla GE MR750 Scanner  with 50 mT/m gradients 
* 7 Tesla Philips Achieva Scanner
