# Probtrackx GPU

Tool for performing probabilistic tractography on NVIDIA GPUs

Part of [FSL](https://fsl.fmrib.ox.ac.uk/fsl/fslwiki) (FMRIB Software Library)

For information about the functionality of the tool, see the [PROBTRACKX User Guide](https://fsl.fmrib.ox.ac.uk/fsl/fslwiki/FDT/UserGuide#BEDPOSTX)

This page provides binary downloads of the GPU version of Probtrackx. 

## Installation

 - Download the correct probtrackx2_gpu file for your CUDA version
 - Unzip ``probtrackx2_gpu`` file
 - Copy the binary file into your ``$FSLDIR/bin`` directory
 - To execute it use: ``$FSLDIR/bin/probtrackx2_gpu``

## Speedup

GPU Probtrackx offers accelerations of *more than 200 times using a single GPU compared to 
a single CPU core: 1 GPU â‰ˆ 230 CPU cores.*

*a) Execution times (in logarithmic scale) and speedup (standard deviation Ïƒ is also shown) in the reconstruction of 15 tracts comparing a GPU-based with a CPU-based probabilistic tractography framework. (b) Execution times (in logarithmic scale) and speedup (and its standard deviation Ïƒ) reconstructing 27 tracts. (c) Execution times (in logarithmic scale) and speedup (and std) generating a dense connectome, taking and without taking into account the time spent for merging results from differenc CPU cores (required only in the CPU-based solution).*

*Coronal, sagittal and axial views comparing CPU-based and GPU-based frameworks performing probabilistic tractography and reconstructing some major white matter tracts. Each colour represents a different brain white matter tract. These paths are binarised versions of the path distributions after being thresholded at 0.5%.*

*Path probability map from a vertex in the Motor Cortex. The map was extracted from dense connectome matrices reconstructed with CPU-based and GPU-based probabilistic tractography applications.*
