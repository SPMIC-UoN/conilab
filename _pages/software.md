# Software

We have a track record of developing software for brain image
processing and analysis. A number of our tools are publicly released
through [FSL]{https://fsl.fmrib.ox.ac.uk/fsl/fslwiki}, one of the
de-facto software standards for multi-modal neuroimage processing,
used by thousands of researchers in hundreds of institutions worldwide.


### FSL Toolboxes

We have led the development or contributed to a number of FSL toolboxes, including:
*XTRACT
*eddy_qc
*bedpostx / bedpostx_gpu
*probtrackx / probtrackx_gpu
*eddy

### CUDIMOT
CUDIMOT is a front-end that allows the definition and fitting of
non-linear voxelwise models to MRI data using CUDA and GPUs. The user
needs only to specify the cost function and the required model fitting
options (determinsitic, stochastic, priors, noise model) and the
software translates these choices to CUDA code, which is then compiled
to a GPU binary.
